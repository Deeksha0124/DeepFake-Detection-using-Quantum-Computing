Deepfake technology poses a growing threat, making it essential to develop robust detection methods. 
Traditional machine learning models face limitations in detecting highly sophisticated deepfakes.
This project adopts a hybrid quantum-classical approach, integrating Quantum Transfer Learning (QTL) with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to enhance detection accuracy.
By leveraging quantum computing for feature extraction and classical deep learning for classification, we aim to improve the efficiency and reliability of deepfake detection systems.

This is an ongoing team project, I am still working on it.
